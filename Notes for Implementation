TO MOVE TANK ON SURFACE. WHENEVER WE HAVE A UPAR NEECHE TYPE SURFACE SO WE WILL CHECK IF THE TANK OVERLAPS WITH TILE, IF YES THEN WE WILL CHANGE THE ORIENTATION.
HOW??/

- WHEN NORMAL MOVING ON GROUND


-WHEN TANK IS MOVING ON HORIZONTAL GROUND AND ENCOUNTERS A TILE IN FRONT


-WHEN TANK IS MOVING VERTICALLY UP AND ENCOUNTERS NO TILE ON A SURFACE TO MOVE


-WHEN TANK IS MOVING VERTICALLY DOWN AND ENCOUNTERS TILE IN FRONT
